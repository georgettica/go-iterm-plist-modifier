# go-iterm-plist-modifier

## Purpose

as a DevOps Engineer, I wanted that each of my configuration steps will be automated as much as possible

one step I found that was not solved fully, is the Iterm2 configuration.

This repository attempts to solve this problem by making the iterm2 configuration as simple as `ITERM_PLIST_MODIFIER_LOCATION=<PATH> go run main.go` on the exposed plist file iterm2 provides and get all the best practices you want

## Usage

Configure Iterm2 to save the plist file to a location you desire, see documentation on how to do that https://stackoverflow.com/a/23356086[here]

run the go binary on the file and it'll overide in the UI the config file as a json format

## Future Development Ideas:
- [ ] - allow setting the Object we want, and merging the current one with the new one
- [ ] - the NewBookmarks possiby is configurable via 'iterm2', find a way to make it more constant
- [ ] - override the plist file with the correct values
- [ ] - decide if `Dynamic Profiles` is the better way to go https://iterm2.com/documentation-dynamic-profiles.html[see here]
